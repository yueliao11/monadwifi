# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing WiFi payment application by adding background polling functionality that continuously checks the WiFiDog temporary pass endpoint after page load. The enhancement maintains all existing payment logic while adding automated status checking and final redirection to Baidu upon completion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the WiFi payment page, I want the system to automatically check my connection status in the background, so that I can be redirected immediately when access is granted without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL start polling `http://192.168.1.249:2060/wifidog/temporary_pass` every 3 seconds
2. WHEN polling is active THEN the system SHALL continue checking regardless of wallet connection status
3. WHEN polling encounters network errors THEN the system SHALL continue polling without interrupting the user interface
4. WHEN the page is unloaded THEN the system SHALL stop all polling activities to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who has completed the payment process, I want to be automatically redirected to Baidu when my WiFi access is confirmed, so that I can immediately start browsing without additional steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the polling endpoint returns a success response THEN the system SHALL redirect to `https://www.baidu.com`
2. WHEN redirection occurs THEN the system SHALL stop all polling activities
3. WHEN payment is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL continue polling until redirection occurs
4. IF polling detects access granted before payment completion THEN the system SHALL still redirect to Baidu

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing payment functionality to remain unchanged, so that the new polling feature doesn't interfere with the current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background polling is active THEN all existing wallet connection features SHALL function normally
2. WHEN background polling is active THEN all existing payment processing SHALL function normally  
3. WHEN background polling is active THEN all existing UI interactions SHALL remain responsive
4. WHEN payment completes THEN the existing success messages and status updates SHALL still display normally

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the polling implementation to be robust and efficient, so that it doesn't impact application performance or user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing polling THEN the system SHALL use a configurable interval (default 3 seconds)
2. WHEN polling fails THEN the system SHALL log errors without displaying them to users
3. WHEN multiple polling requests are pending THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without conflicts
4. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup all polling timers and requests
